1. Run "npm i" in terminal to install dependencies
2. Run "node index"

This will create an "output.csv" file containing the slcsp rates available for each zipcode.
The order of the rows will appear exactly the same as they were in the original "slcsp.csv" file, along with the proper headers.

(Note: To preserve the original "slcsp.csv" file, the output is written onto an "output.csv" file instead. This can be fixed on L51 of "index.js")
